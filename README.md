Neural networks projects for a Deep Learning academic course

## Dog breed classification
Project using feed-forward and convolutional neural networks coded from scratch to classify dog breeds based on images from the
[Stanford Dogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) dataset.

## Holiday photographs clustering
Project using pre-trained deep neural networks to generate image embeddings and perform clustering of personal collection of photographs.

## Beer review generation
Project using recurrent neural networks to generate style-specific beer reviews based on reviews scraped from RateBeer.
