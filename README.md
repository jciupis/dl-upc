Neural networks projects for a Deep Learning academic course

## Dog breed classification using neural networks
This is an academic project using various kinds of neural networks to classify dog breeds based on images from the
[Stanford Dogs](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) dataset.

## Holiday photographs clustering using image embeddings
This is an academic project using pre-trained deep neural networks to generate image embeddings and perform clustering
of personal collection of photographs.
